/**
 * The package with wrapper classes.
 *
 * <p>
 * The RxMicro framework uses classes from the {@code rxmicro.json} module when automatically converting Java models
 * to JSON format and vice versa.
 *
 * <p>
 * Therefore, a developer should not explicitly use this module!
 *
 * <p>
 * But sometimes it is necessary to work with JSON format manually: for test writing, geo coding, etc...
 * For such cases the RxMicro framework introduces {@code io.rxmicro.json.wrapper} package.
